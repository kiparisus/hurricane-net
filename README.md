Supplementary data used in "Integrated GIS- and network-based framework for assessing urban critical infrastructure accessibility and resilience: the case of Hurricane Michael"

This dataset represents a network of Panama City in its three system states:

- `s0.gml` -- pre-hurricane system as of October 2018;
- `s1.gml` -- network affected by the hurricane with obstructed edges removed;
- `s2.gml` -- network in the recovery process as of June 2024.

The dataset was built based on the following open data:
